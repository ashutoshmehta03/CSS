/* 1. What is CSS? */

/* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It is used to style the HTML content of a webpage — meaning it controls colors, size, layout, fonts, spacing, animations, and overall design.

/* In simple words: HTML makes the structure, CSS makes it beautiful. */

2. Role of CSS (Why CSS is used?)

CSS is used for:

1. Designing the webpage

Colors
Fonts
Backgrounds
Borders

2. Layout / Positioning

Placing elements side-by-side
Making grids & flex layouts
Responsive designs

3. Improving user experience

Hover effects
Transitions
Smooth animations

4. Responsive Design

Making websites look good on mobile, tablet, laptop

5. Separating Design from Structure

HTML = content
CSS = design
JS = behavior
This separation makes code clean and easy to maintain.

3. CSS Definition (Simple)

CSS is a styling language used to make webpages beautiful by controlling colors, fonts, layout, and overall design.

HTML without CSS

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is a normal paragraph.</p>
