Below is the complete, clear, and professional explanation of Block Elements & Inline Elements — including definition, examples, full lists, and how to convert block ↔ inline with examples.


---

⭐ 1. What is a Block Element? (Definition)

A block element is an HTML element that:

✔ Always starts on a new line
✔ Takes the full available width (100% width)
✔ Can have top/bottom margin & padding
✔ Occupies its own “block” in the layout

In simple words:
👉 A block element pushes content to the next line and expands fully.

⭐ Examples of Block Elements (Old + New HTML5)

Common Block Elements

<div>

<p>

<h1> to <h6>

<ul>, <ol>, <li>

<table>

<form>

<section>

<article>

<header>

<footer>

<nav>

<aside>

<main>

<blockquote>

<pre>

<hr>


Example

<p>This is a block element.</p>
<div>This also takes full width.</div>


---

⭐ 2. What is an Inline Element? (Definition)

An inline element is an element that:

✔ Does NOT start on a new line
✔ Takes only the width of its content
✔ Does NOT allow top/bottom margin**
✔ Stays inside the flow of text

In simple words:
👉 Inline elements stay in the same line and only take required space.

⭐ Examples of Inline Elements (Old + HTML5)

Common Inline Elements

<span>

<a>

<strong>

<em>

<b>

<i>

<u>

<img>

<label>

<small>

<sub> / <sup>

<code>

<mark>

<abbr>

<time>


Example

<span>This is inline.</span>
<a href="#">This is also inline.</a>

Both stay on the same line.

⭐ 3. Block vs Inline (Quick Comparison)

Feature Block Element Inline Element

Starts new line? Yes No
Width Full width Only required width
Margin allowed All sides Only left & right
Supports height? Yes No (mostly ignored)
Example <div>, <p> <span>, <a>

⭐ 4. Convert Block Element → Inline Element

(Yes, possible)

You can convert a block element into an inline element using:

display: inline;

Example

HTML:

<div class="example">Hello</div>

CSS:

.example {
  display: inline;
}

Result:
<div> (normally block) becomes inline → stays on the same line.


---

⭐ 5. Convert Inline Element → Block Element

(Yes, possible)

You can convert an inline element into a block element using:

display: block;

Example

HTML:

<span class="box">Hello</span>

CSS:

.box {
  display: block;
  width: 200px;
}

Result:
<span> (normally inline) behaves like a block.

⭐ 6. Bonus: Convert to Inline-Block

(Combination of both behaviours)

display: inline-block;

✔ Does NOT start new line
✔ Allows width, height, margin, padding like block
✔ Useful for buttons, cards, navigation

Example

.button {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 150px;
  padding: 10px;
}

⭐ Final Summary

Block Element

Starts new line

Full width

Example: <div>, <p>, <h1>


Inline Element

Same line

Only content width

Example: <span>, <a>, <strong>


Conversions

Block → Inline → display: inline;

Inline → Block → display: block;

Inline-Block → display: inline-block;
